## üèéÔ∏è Overview

Many assume Formula 1 is purely about speed, but that's only part of the story.
Race wins and podiums come from a careful blend of **qualifying performance**, **pit stop execution**, **lap time consistency**, and **strategic decision-making**.

This page explores how success in F1 comes not just from raw speed but from many factors that contribute to a drivers and a teams success.

## üß≠ Interactive Visualizations

### Sprint vs Race: Position Change

This bar chart shows which drivers gained or lost the most positions from sprint to main races. A negative number means they moved up in the main race, a sign of race-day execution.

```{r}
sprint_delta = inner_join(sprint_results, results, by = c("raceId", "driverId")) %>%
  mutate(pos_change = as.numeric(positionOrder.x) - as.numeric(positionOrder.y)) %>%
  inner_join(drivers, by = "driverId") %>%
  mutate(name = paste(forename, surname)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(pos_change))

plot_ly(data = sprint_delta, x = ~name, y = ~pos_change, type = "bar",
        color = ~pos_change, colors = "RdBu") %>%
  layout(title = "Position Gained from Sprint to Main Race",
         xaxis = list(title = "Driver", tickangle = -45),
         yaxis = list(title = "Sprint - Main Position"))
```

### Total Pit Stops per Driver

This chart highlights the drivers with the most cumulative pit stops. Frequent pit stops might suggest poor race circumstances or team strategy 
decisions.

```{r}
pit_counts = pit_stops %>%
  group_by(driverId) %>%
  summarise(total_pits = n()) %>%
  inner_join(drivers, by = "driverId") %>%
  mutate(name = paste(forename, surname)) %>%
  top_n(15, total_pits)

plot_ly(pit_counts, x = ~reorder(name, total_pits), y = ~total_pits, type = "bar",
        marker = list(color = 'mediumpurple')) %>%
  layout(title = "Top 15 Drivers with Most Total Pit Stops",
         xaxis = list(title = "Driver", tickangle = -45),
         yaxis = list(title = "Total Pit Stops"))
```

### Grid Position vs Points Scored

This scatterplot shows how qualifying grid position relates to total points scored. Generally, drivers who start near the front tend to earn more points.

```{r}
qual_vs_points = results %>%
  filter(!is.na(grid) & !is.na(points)) %>%
  inner_join(drivers, by = "driverId") %>%
  mutate(name = paste(forename, surname))

plot_ly(qual_vs_points, x = ~grid, y = ~points, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
        text = ~name, color = ~points, colors = "viridis") %>%
  layout(title = "Grid Position vs Points Scored",
         xaxis = list(title = "Qualifying Grid Position"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Points Earned"))
```

### 1. Average Lap Time by Driver

This chart shows the average lap times of the fastest 15 drivers. Lower lap times indicate better pace and consistency, critical for maintaining competitive track position.

```{r}
avg_laps = lap_times %>%
  group_by(driverId) %>%
  summarise(avg_ms = mean(milliseconds, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  inner_join(drivers, by = "driverId") %>%
  mutate(name = paste(forename, surname)) %>%
  top_n(-15, avg_ms)

ggplot(avg_laps, aes(x = reorder(name, avg_ms), y = avg_ms / 1000)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 15 Fastest Average Lap Times",
       x = "Driver", y = "Avg Lap Time (s)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 2. Average Pit Duration by Driver

This graph compares the average pit stop durations of drivers. Shorter pit stops save precious seconds that can affect overall race placement.

```{r}
avg_pit_time = pit_stops %>%
  group_by(driverId) %>%
  summarise(avg_duration = mean(milliseconds, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  inner_join(drivers, by = "driverId") %>%
  mutate(name = paste(forename, surname)) %>%
  top_n(-10, avg_duration)

ggplot(avg_pit_time, aes(x = reorder(name, avg_duration), y = avg_duration)) +
  geom_col(fill = "tomato") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Fastest Average Pit Stop Times",
       x = "Driver", y = "Avg Pit Time (ms)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 3. Sprint Finishing Position Distribution

This boxplot visualizes how drivers typically perform in sprint races. It shows the range and consistency of finishing positions across multiple events.

```{r}
box_sprint = sprint_results %>%
  inner_join(drivers, by = "driverId") %>%
  mutate(name = paste(forename, surname))

ggplot(box_sprint, aes(x = "Sprint", y = as.numeric(positionOrder))) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Sprint Race Finishing Positions", y = "Position") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 4. Number of Podium Finishes

This bar chart highlights the 15 drivers with the most top-3 finishes, emphasizing race-day performance and consistency across full seasons.

```{r}
podiums = results %>%
  filter(positionOrder %in% c(1,2,3)) %>%
  group_by(driverId) %>%
  summarise(podiums = n()) %>%
  inner_join(drivers, by = "driverId") %>%
  mutate(name = paste(forename, surname)) %>%
  top_n(15, podiums)

ggplot(podiums, aes(x = reorder(name, podiums), y = podiums)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#FF5F05") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 15 Drivers with Most Podium Finishes",
       x = "Driver", y = "Number of Podiums") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 5. Average Points per Completed Lap

This scatterplot demonstrates how finishing rank correlates with points earned. While better finishes yield more points, anomalies suggest the impact of sprint formats and penalties.

```{r}
points_vs_rank = results %>%
  filter(!is.na(rank), !is.na(points)) %>%
  inner_join(drivers, by = "driverId") %>%
  mutate(name = paste(forename, surname))

ggplot(points_vs_rank, aes(x = as.numeric(rank), y = points)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = "forestgreen") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Points vs Finishing Rank",
       x = "Finishing Rank", y = "Points Scored") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 6. Age vs Total Points

This scatterplot shows how total pit stop time impacts race points. Drivers with shorter pit durations tend to score more, showing the importance of efficient pit crew execution.

```{r}
driver_ages = results %>%
  inner_join(drivers, by = "driverId") %>%
  group_by(driverId, forename, surname, dob) %>%
  summarise(points = sum(points, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(dob) & as.Date(dob) > as.Date("1965-01-01")) %>%  # reasonable age cutoff (~60 y/o)
  mutate(age = as.numeric(difftime(Sys.Date(), as.Date(dob), units = "days")) / 365.25,
         name = paste(forename, surname)) %>%
  filter(age <= 60)

ggplot(driver_ages, aes(x = age, y = points)) +
  geom_point(color = "orange", alpha = 0.6, size = 2.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Driver Age vs Total Points (Under 60)",
       x = "Age (Years)", y = "Total Career Points") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## üèÅ Conclusion

Strategy matters.
Success in Formula 1 is rarely about speed alone.

Across the visualizations above, a consistent theme emerges: execution and adaptability win races. Drivers who finish well aren‚Äôt always those who qualify best, they‚Äôre the ones with smart pit strategies, consistent lap times, and the ability to navigate changing race conditions.

Sprint races highlight drivers‚Äô resilience and race-day adjustments.

Pit stop efficiency can mean the difference between podiums and lost points.

Consistency, seen in lap times and average performance, is often more telling than occasional brilliance, or fast lap.

The data confirms what seasoned fans know, F1 is as much about teamwork, timing, and tactics as it is about raw speed. This story, told through lap times, pit stop data, and driver performance, shows that victory comes from a complete, synchronized effort between the driver and the team.
